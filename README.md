# Quasar Source

#### Development Screenshots and Progress List:

###### March 22nd : Heavy refactorings! TODO list.
##### Quasar
- [ ] Add various graphical improvements such as transparent FloatingWall objects and giving certain 3D texts a black background.
- [ ] Make certain interactivity more intuitive. Such as adding abstraction to Floating2DInput fields for input state.
- [ ] Add a cursor for typing on Floating2DInput fields!
- [ ] Fix all bugs on the login page.
- [ ] AJAX requests : add abstraction, add locks to user-state and objects that initiate requests such as buttons.
- [ ] Saving : Make it automatic, abstract the design, and perform batch saving to improve performance. *(This will fix the entity deletion bug)*
##### CodeAPI
- [X] Re-create base design. Taking pros from the previous 2 CodeAPI systems created.
- [X] Create generation for all scripts.
- [ ] Add more scripts for server management and setup.
- [ ] Re-create all Finance generation code needed.
- [X] Add ability to create production version of Quasar!
- [ ] Synchronize all global/shared variables across languages. Such as server messages and entity properties.

##### General
- [ ] Create standardized time abstraction code.
- [ ] Synchronize all code for systems involved with entities.
- [ ] Remove all un-used code from project. Refactor any salvageable code.
- [ ] Setup all remaining servers needed to be setup.

- [ ] Look into setting up Khafka or RabbitMQ.

##### Finance
- [ ] Find and automate crypto price data fetcher.
