Cost Basis

Your average cost basis for a stock can be viewed on the stock screen below the chart. The average cost basis is calculated from only buy orders and does not change to reflect sells.

Robinhood uses the “First In, First Out” method. This means that your longest-held shares are recorded as being sold first when you sell a stock you own. The shares themselves are not specifically tracked, but the cost associated with those shares is expensed first.
