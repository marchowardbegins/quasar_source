Description: {
    Every application with custom 3D front-end will utilize the 'Quasar Engine'. This engine provides common-reusable tools
    as well as doing a great deal of management work such as state based logic, logic loops, and rendering loops.
}

Technical Documentation: {
    // Each application will start with the following template:

    window.onload = function() {
        // Entire application will start and run from here.

        // Create an instance of the Quasar Engine and run it. A promise will be returned indicating if the engine started successfully
    }
}
