    <h1>1.1</h1>
    <p>If an equation involves the derivative of one variable with respect to another, then the former is called a <b>dependent variable</b> and the latter an <b>independent variable</b>.
    Thus, in the equation `(d^2x)/(dt^2)+a(dx/dt)+kx=0`, t is the independent variable and x is the dependent variable.</p><br>
    <p>The <b>order</b> is the order of the highest-order derivatives present in the equation.</p><br>
    <p>A <b>linear differential equation</b> is one in which the dependent variable y is and its derivatives appear in additive combinations of their powers.
    A differential equation is linear if it has the format `a_n(x)((d^ny)/(dx^n))+a_(n-1)(x)((d^(n-1)y)/(dxn^(n-1)))+...+a_1(x)dy/dx+a_0(x)y=F(x)`, where `a_n(x)`,`a_(n-1)(x)`,...,`a_0(x)` and `F(x)` depend only on the independent variable x.</p>
